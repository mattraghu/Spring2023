# Incremental Analysis and Sensitivity Analysis

## Incremental Analysis

Incremental analysis is a technique used to rank projects based on costs, benefits, and the benefit-cost ratio. The steps involved in the incremental analysis process are:

1. Rank the projects based on costs, from lowest to highest.
2. Calculate the present worth of benefits (PW of B) and present worth of costs (PW of C) for each project.
3. Calculate the change in PW of benefits (ΔPW of B) and change in PW of costs (ΔPW of C) for each project.
4. Calculate the change in benefit-cost ratio (ΔB/C) for each project.
5. Determine whether the change in benefit-cost ratio is justified for each project and move on to the next project in order.

## Sensitivity Analysis

Sensitivity analysis is a technique used to assess the impact of changes in project parameters on the present worth of benefits and costs. The steps involved in the sensitivity analysis process are:

1. Define upper and lower limits for the parameter being analyzed.
2. Calculate the present worths for the upper, lower, and base values of the parameter.
3. Calculate the deviation from the base present worth for the upper and lower values of the parameter.
4. Calculate the percent deviation from the base present worth for the upper and lower values of the parameter.
5. Calculate the sensitivity ratio, which is the percent change in deviation over the percent change in the parameter.
6. Graph the results by plotting the present worths on the y-axis and the percent change in the parameter on the x-axis.

By using incremental and sensitivity analysis techniques, project managers can make informed decisions about which projects to pursue and how to adjust project parameters to optimize project outcomes.
