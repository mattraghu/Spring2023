### Script Information for `julian.py`
#### Script: 

```python
from datetime import date
from jdcal import *
now = date.today()
jd = gcal2jd(now.year, now.month, now.day)
print('Calendar Date: {:s}'.format(now.isoformat()))
print('Julian Date: {:0.1f}'.format(jd[0]+jd[1]))
print('Modified Julian Date: {:0.1f}'.format(jd[1]))

```

# Code Explanation

### Importing Required Libraries
```python
from datetime import date
from jdcal import *
```
In this code snippet, we have imported 'date' module from datetime library and 'gcal2jd' function from 'jdcal' library. We will be using these libraries to generate the Julian and Modified Julian Date.

### Getting today's date
```python
now = date.today()
```
Here, we are obtaining today's date using `date.today()` function and storing it in the `now` variable.

### Calculating Julian and Modified Julian Dates
```python
jd = gcal2jd(now.year, now.month, now.day)
```
With this line of code, we are using the obtained `now` date variable to calculate the corresponding Julian and Modified Julian Dates using the `gcal2jd()` function. 

### Printing the Output
```python
print('Calendar Date: {:s}'.format(now.isoformat()))
print('Julian Date: {:0.1f}'.format(jd[0]+jd[1]))
print('Modified Julian Date: {:0.1f}'.format(jd[1]))
```
Finally, we are printing the output to the console. The first line outputs the calendar date in yyyy-mm-dd format. The second line prints the Julian date, which is the sum of the two values returned by `gcal2jd()` function. The third line prints the Modified Julian Date, which is one of the two values returned by the `gcal2jd()` function.

In this way, the code generates the Julian and Modified Julian Date for the current date and prints the output to the console.
