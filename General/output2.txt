- Beethoven steeped in Enlightenment ideals
- Absorbed music of Haydn and Mozart
- Affected by French Revolution
- Idealized, then disillusioned by Napoleon
- Endured occupation and economic privation during Napoleon Wars
- Lived last dozen years under political repression
- Promising piano virtuoso and composer
- Forced to cease performing due to deafness 
- First musician to make a living almost exclusively as a composer 
- Three periods of Beethoven's career: 
    - First, from birth to about 1802, Beethoven found personal voice while mastering musical language and genres
    - Second, through 1814, developed style achieving new level of drama and expression, gaining popularity 
    - Third, from 1815 until his death in 1827, music became more introspective, more difficult for performers and listeners
- Trained by father and other local musicians in Bonn
- Entered service of elector of Cologne, Maximilian Franz, and attracted notice as pianist and improviser
- Haydn praised Beethoven's music and urged elector to send him to Vienna for further study
- Beethoven took lessons with Haydn, interrupted when Haydn left for London in 1794
- Studied counterpoint for a year with Johann Georg Albrechtsberger 
- Studied how to set Italian poetry with Antonio Salieri 
- Beethoven sought to place himself beside Haydn in the minds of the public 
- Wrote largest group of works during first decade in Vienna: sonatas, variations, and shorter works for piano 
- Relatively difficult passages or movements appeared next to easier ones, perhaps to challenge the player 
- Beethoven often used strong contrasts of style or topic to delineate the form and broaden the expressive range
- Used frequent octaves, thick textures, and abrupt changes of dynamics 
- "Sonate path√©tique" depicted suffering and a tragic mode of expression- The sonata is in C minor with stormy outer movements and a calm slow movement in A major
- The first movement has a dramatic slow introduction of grief that is recalled multiple times throughout the movement
- The main themes of the movement are energetic and determined with the motive of the introduction transformed and assimilated into the character of the Allegro
- The sonata-rondo finale is serious and intense
- Beethoven's personality shows through in the individuality of every movement, character of his themes, unexpected turns of phrase, unconventional modulations, and subtleties of form
- The slow movement of No. 1 was inspired by the burial vault scene of Romeo and Juliet and is striking and operatic
- Beethoven's Symphony No. 1 in C Major shows his allegiance to the model of Haydn's and Mozart's late symphonies but with distinctive differences 
- Around 1803, Beethoven began composing in a new, more ambitious style due to his reputation, support of patrons and publishers, and his growing loss of hearing
- Beethoven had generous patrons, including important noble families in Vienna who provided him with a lifetime annuity to stay in Vienna
- The financial support Beethoven received freed him to compose largely as he wished, although he often failed to meet deadlines
- Beethoven composed with great deliberation.- In 1802, Beethoven realized he was going deaf and was in despair, but resolved to continue composing for the sake of his art
- His compositions reflected his struggle and experiences, often portraying a protagonist who overcomes great odds
- Beethoven expanded traditional forms and themes to achieve great variety and dramatic conflict in his music
- His Symphony No. 3 in E-flat Major, named Sinfonia Eroica, exemplifies his new approach and reflects his understanding of heroism from ancient Greek and Roman literature
- One possible interpretation suggests the first movement encapsulates a story of challenge, struggle, and final victory
- The movement uses a fast triple meter and a traditional deutsche melody, but the chromatic descent and unique presentation suggest the protagonist is of common rather than noble origin.- The heroic content lies in the transformation of the opening motive over the course of the movement
- The motive undergoes several transformations, including being treated in sequence with a rising chromatic tail, disguised as a new theme in minor, and striving upward before tumbling back down
- The motive achieves a new form by the end of the movement
- The principal antagonist is a leaping figure with strong accents on weak beats, creating a forceful duple meter against the main motive's serene triple meter
- The development builds to a terrifying, dissonant climax, with the main motive gradually struggling to reassert itself
- The piece showcases economy of material, expansion of form, and a sense of struggle, achievement, and progressive change
- The second movement has strong links to the French Republic, with thirty-second-note upbeats imitating the roll of muffled drums used in Revolutionary processions and a C-major section with the character of a Revolutionary hymn
- Beethoven originally named the symphony "Bonaparte" in honor of Napoleon, but tore up the title page when he crowned himself emperor
- Beethoven wavered in his opinion of Napoleon, conducting the symphony during French Occupation and considering dedicating his Mass in C, Op. 86, to the emperor- Beethoven's music attracted a broad and devoted public more than his predecessors'
- Middle to late eighteenth century instrumental music was rooted in the galant style, relying on familiar schemata
- Beethoven's music grew out of the same stylistic tradition, but each piece had individual internal logic
- The Eroica and Beethoven's later symphonies became the center of the symphonic tradition that could rivet a first-time listener
- Fidelio glorified heroism and humanitarian ideals of the Revolution
- Beethoven's string quartets tested the limits of amateur players
- Concertos of his middle period were composed on a grander scale 
- Beethoven expanded music's expressive range and dimensions
- Solos were coequal with the orchestra, playing the part of a hero in a drama
- Beethoven's Fifth Symphony embodied the experience of the sublime
- The symphony had a rhythmic figure that recurred in various guises in other movements
- Beethoven's deafness made him become morbidly suspicious and retreat into himself
- Financial problems and ill health plagued Beethoven, making it difficult to continue composing
- Final defeat of Napoleon and postwar depression made it difficult to produce large-scale public works
- Beethoven sympathized with republican government ideals and was spied on by government security forces- Beethoven's late works were not politically linked like Fidelio or the Eroica Symphony
- The musical language became more introspective and aimed at a smaller audience
- Classical forms remained but were recognizable under new contours
- A key element of Beethoven's late style was high contrast, with extremes meeting in pieces like the Missa solemnis and Ninth Symphony
- Contrasts of topic became exaggerated, involving style, figuration, character, meter, and tempo
- Beethoven emphasized continuity while balancing contrasts
- An die ferne Geliebte inaugurated the song cycle genre
- Beethoven used variation technique to reexamine the substance of themes
- New sonorities were introduced including pizzicatos and sul ponticello effects
- Beethoven used familiar styles and genres for expressive purposes and to reflect on tradition
- Imitative counterpoint, especially fugue, was characteristic of Beethoven's late works
- Beethoven reconceived the number and arrangement of movements while seeking to integrate them closer through motivic and key relationships
