• basso continuo, monody, and recitative; new styles, marked by   unprepared dissonance, greater focus on the solo voice or   instrument, and idiomatic playing; and new genres, including   opera
• basso continuo (Italian for “continuous bass”) or simply   continuo. In this system, the composer wrote out the melody or   melodies and the bass line but left it to the performers to fill   in the appropriate chords or inner parts.  
• qualities of extravagance, decoration, and focus on drama and   expression in much music of the times
• Perception and perceived effect lay at the heart of the new   styles in art and music around 1600, including the second   practice (see pp. 287–90) and recitative, and in the new genres   developed throughout the century, from opera, cantata, and   oratorio to solo sonata, trio sonata, suite, overture, and   concerto.  
• realization—the actual playing—of such a bass varied according   to the type of piece and the skill and taste of the player, who   had considerable room for improvisation. The performer might   play only chords, or add passing tones
• political advantage within the Holy Roman Empire precipitated   the Thirty Years’ War
• The English Civil War (1642–49), primarily a battle for power   between the king and Parliament
• individuals, who would invest or spend it locally and thus   boost the economy
• Among the effects on music were the rise of public opera and   public concerts, as well as an increased demand from the upper   and middle classes for published music, musical instruments, and   music lessons
• dissonance less as an interval between voices than as a note   that does not fit into a chord. As a result, a greater variety   of dissonances was tolerated
• after midcentury, German courts and free city-states built up   their musical establishments
• Chromaticism was used especially to express intense emotions in   vocal works, to suggest harmonic exploration in instrumental   pieces, and to create distinctive subjects for treatment in   imitative counterpoint
• The church continued to support music, although its role was   less important than it had been in previous centuries, after the   reform of benefices by the Council of Trent deprived churches   and court chapels of a major source of funding and of   talent
• Treble-bass polarity and the use of continuo altered the   balance among the parts, replacing the polyphony of equal voices   typical of the sixteenth century with an emphasis on the bass.   Even in imitative counterpoint the individual melodic lines were   subordinated to a succession of chords implied by the bass,   producing a counterpoint driven by harmony.  
• Regular and flexible rhythm Music in the Baroque period was   either very metric or very free
• tended to equalize vocal and instrumental styles
• Composers of the Baroque period sought musical means to express   or arouse the affections, also called affects (pronounced   AF-fects) or passions. These were rationalized emotions such as   sadness, joy, anger, love, fear, excitement, or wonder.  
• music is centered on the performer and performance, not the   composer and the work.
• for every motion stimulating the senses there is a particular   emotion evoked in the soul. Grief, joy, and other affections are   universal experiences, not specific to an individual; they are   more like colors, an objective reality that can be described,   than like taste, which may differ from person to person.  
• arts sought to move the emotions and conjure the passions, it   became a matter of interest to codify the affections
• believed that experiencing a range of affections through music   could bring the spirits in the body into better balance,   promoting physical and psychological health, so that both vocal   and instrumental works typically offered a succession of   contrasting moods.
• Numerous dissonances (marked by in the example) violate the   rules of counterpoint
• Precisely because the music does not follow its expected path,   we are wrenched in a way that dramatizes the emotions expressed   in the text, and we recognize and empathize with those feelings.  
• Monteverdi’s madrigal was criticized in Giovanni Maria Artusi’s   L’Artusi overo Delle imperfettioni della moderna musica (The   Artusi, or Of the Imperfections of Modern Music, 1600), not for   its dissonances but for needlessly breaking the rules. Artusi   points out, for example, that the dissonances in measure 13   would be allowed if the cantus moved by step (G–A–G–F–E) and   asks why the rules are deliberately flaunted
•   distinguished between a prima pratica, or first practice, the   sixteenth-century style of vocal polyphony codified by Zarlino,   and a seconda pratica, or second practice, used by modern   Italians. They explained that in the first practice the music   had to follow its own rules and thus dominated the verbal text,   while in the second practice the music serves to heighten the   effect and rhetorical power of the words
• one aspect of music that did not hold constant is harmonic   organization. Musicians in the early seventeenth century still   thought of themselves as working within the eight church modes   or the expanded system of twelve modes codified by Glareanus   (see Chapter 7). By the last third of the century, Corelli,   Lully, and other composers were writing music we would   unhesitatingly call tonal, operating within the system of major   and minor keys
• n Spanish styles and dance rhythms, with recitative monologues   reserved for the most dramatic moments. Hidalgo also wrote music   for many plays. Together with Calde
