• profusion of individual idioms in the twentieth century had as a corollary the breakdown of any common musical language. Composers in earlier eras shared a fund of musical resources, styles, and procedures, but all that musicians as diverse as Sheng, Adams, Ligeti, and Gubaidulina had in common was their heritage as composers in the classical tradition
• continuations of modernism
• minimalism, in which materials are reduced to a minimum and procedures simplified so that what is going on in the music is immediately apparent
• for example, country musicians who grew up in the 1960s and 1970s and began professional careers in the 1980s and 1990s found it natural to incorporate sounds and styles from the rock music they heard in their youth. Crossing and blending traditions became commonplace.
• Composers of minimalist works absorbed influences from rock, African music, Asian music, tonality, and finally Romanticism, to create what has been called the leading musical style of the late twentieth century
• mixed media challenged old distinctions between art and popular music and between music, theater, dance, and other arts
• interest in reaching a broad audience produced a number of new currents, including minimalism and neo-Romanticism
• polystylism, the juxtaposition of contrasting styles from different historical eras;
• Estonian composer Arvo Pärt (b. 1935), shown in Figure 38.15, forged a highly individual, instantly recognizable style using the simplest materials
• Following early neoclassical and serial works, and others that contrasted modernist with Baroque styles, he turned to a study of Gregorian chant and early polyphony
• he devised a method he called tintinnabuli, after the bell-like sonorities it produced.
• Its essence lies in counterpoint between a pitch-centered, mostly stepwise diatonic melody and one or more other voices that sound only notes of the tonic triad, with the placement of each note determined by a preset system
• Tabula rasa, Fratres (Brothers), and Cantus in memorium Benjamin Britten (all 1977), then increasingly focused on religious choral music
• leaving the Soviet Union in 1980. With its calm, steady tempo, quiet surface, gentle diatonic dissonances, and stylistic features reminiscent of medieval chant and early church polyphony, his music suggests an aura of mysticism
• tintinnabuli technique and choral style are exemplified in his Seven Magnificat Antiphons
• The second tenor (the lower part on the tenor staff) presents a plain modal tune that is centered on A and that moves no more than a fourth away in either direction
• rhythm is restricted to quarter and half notes, and measures change length to fit the text accentuation
• tenor melody is echoed by the second soprano to form an augmentation canon.
• altos recite the text, phrase by phrase, on D.
• other parts sound notes of the D-minor triad, following strict but simple rules reminiscent of early polyphony
• bass and first tenor surround the second-tenor melody, each singing the note of the D-minor triad that is second closest to the melody note
• first soprano sings the note from the triad that is nearest above the second-soprano melody. The resulting texture alternates between consonance and diatonic dissonance, allowing for variety and dramatic climaxes within a stripped-down, pitch-centered style. 
• Sofia Gubaidulina (b. 1931), shown in Figure 38.13, was born in the Tatar Republic, an autonomous region in central Russia
• Her childhood there, together with her combined Tatar, Russian, Polish, and Jewish heritage, led to a profound interest in blending sounds and influences
• She once said, “I am the place where East and West meet.”
• Despite the official atheism of the Soviet Union, almost all her works have a spiritual dimension
• her violin concerto Offertorium (1980, revised 1982 and 1986), written for violinist Gidon Kremer, which captures the concept of self-sacrifice—paralleling that of Jesus on the cross, or of the composer for the sake of her music—by presenting, deconstructing, and reconstructing, note by note, the theme Frederick the Great offered to Johann Sebastian Bach, who made it the central idea of his Musical Offering (see p. 433 and Example 19.3).
• The five movements of her sonata for violin and cello, Rejoice! (1981), were inspired by eighteenth-century devotional texts.
• sonata expresses the transcendence from ordinary reality to a state of joy and relies particularly on the passage from a fundamental note to its harmonics to embody this journey of consciousness
• fifth movement (NAWM 221), inscribed with the text “Listen to the still small voice within,” is a study in chromatics, tremolos, and harmonics, particularly glissandos from low fundamental notes in the cello to their higher harmonics
• Gubaidulina’s music is both modernist, in its combination of a highly individual musical personality with evocations of the classical tradition, and immediately appealing through its spiritual resonances and beautiful surface textures and timbres
• The music of American guitarist and composer Frank Zappa (1940–1993) exemplifies the convergence of traditions
• he was fascinated by the modernist music of Varèse, Stravinsky, and Webern as well as by rock and roll
• He made his reputation in the 1960s and 1970s with avant-garde rock that broke down distinctions between rock, jazz, and classical music
• Argentine composer Ástor Piazzolla (1921–1992), shown in Figure 38.2, who combined the Argentine tradition of the tango with elements of jazz and classical music to create a new style, nuevo tango (new tango).
• He encountered jazz during his childhood in New York, became a professional tango musician in Argentina, and studied composition with Alberto Ginastera and Nadia Boulanger
• nuevo tango incorporated improvisation from jazz and drew several elements from the classical tradition, including the Baroque procedures of counterpoint, fugue, and passacaglia; modern chromaticism, dissonance, and angular melodies; and the ideas of extended forms and of music worth listening to for its own 
• new style playing with his ensemble in his club in Buenos Aires, Piazzolla moved in 1974 to Rome, writing more-ambitious pieces like Libertango (1974), the three-movement La Camorra (1989), and Five Tango Sensations (1991) on commission from the Kronos Quartet
• In works like his tango opera María de Buenos Aires (1968) and his Double Concerto for guitar, bandoneon, and string orchestra (1985), Piazzolla drew on a living popular tradition to create music in classical genres, like Gershwin in his Rhapsody in Blue and Porgy and Bess. 
• Each of the musicians and pieces mentioned in this section offers one possible response to the diversity of musical culture in the late twentieth century, one way to join together two or more currents from the multivalent heritage of Western music
• There are many such fusions, each an expression of the unique background and ideas of the artists who created it
• As Americans and the technologies of radio and recording spread across the globe after World War II, American popular music could be heard in almost every corner of the planet, influencing popular music everywhere else. Simultaneously, both traditional and popular music from around the world was increasingly available in the last third of the twentieth century on recordings and in live performances by touring groups, marketed in Western nations as world music
• This broad category includes Asian classical traditions from India, Indonesia, China, Japan, Korea, and other lands; ethnic traditions and folk music from all over; and popular musical idioms from non-Western or Latin American nations, which often blend local singing styles, instruments, scales, or other elements with sounds and styles from American or European popular music
• Kronos Quartet is both one of the leading string quartets in the world and one of the classical ensembles most dedicated to performing a wide range of music
• expert performers on their instruments, they approach music with an eclecticism that is far from traditional string quartets, and with the energy and informal garb of a rock band
• widely known and heard ensemble for contemporary classical music, in part because they appeal to audiences outside the worlds of classical music or “new music” 
• recordings that included rock star Jimi Hendrix’s Purple Haze; jazz by Thelonious Monk and Bill Evans; modernist works from earlier in the century by Bartók, Ives, Webern, Shostakovich, and Crumb; and music—much of it commissioned by Kronos—by contemporary composers from John Zorn and Ástor Piazzolla to Terry Riley, Steve Reich, Philip Glass, Arvo Pärt, and Alfred Schnittke
• world beat, a term referring to African popular musics that reached international audiences
• Nigerian Fela Kuti (1938–1997) merged popular styles from the United States and elsewhere with local traditions to create new sounds. In the 1980s, their music in turn began to be heard worldwide, and pop artists in Europe and America incorporated world beat into their own music
• glocalization, a term popularized in the 1990s to indicate the adaptation of global forces to local needs, forging something that is both localized and the product of globalization
• Bright Sheng (b. 1955), shown in Figure 38.4, studied piano as a boy in his native Shanghai. Sent to the province of Qinghai in his teens during the Cultural Revolution, he learned and collected folk music there
• earned degrees in composition at the Shanghai Conservatory and in New York, where he studied with Leonard Bernstein and Chou Wen-chung (b. 1923), a student of Varèse
• made his career in the United States. He seeks to integrate elements of Asian and Western music while respecting the integrity of each, inspired by the attempts of Bartók to do the same with eastern European folk and Western classical music
• the solo cello suite Seven Tunes Heard in China (1995), Sheng joins the European tradition of the Bach cello suites—with sequences, double stops, and implied polyphony—to the playing style of Chinese bowed string instruments, marked by grace notes, glissandos, sudden dynamic changes, and flexible rhythm
• the first movement, Seasons (NAWM 217), the mostly pentatonic Chinese tune used as a source is fragmented and spun out using both Baroque and modernist methods, including polytonality
• Tan Dun (b. 1957), who learned to play traditional string instruments in his native China, then—like Sheng and the others—moved to New York in the 1980s and studied with Chou Wen-chung at Columbia University
• Influenced by John Cage and other experimental composers, he has combined Chinese instruments and non-Western vocal timbres with Western techniques in works such as the film score for Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000) as well as Water Passion after St. Matthew (2000) for soloists, chorus, and orchestra, commissioned to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the death of Johann Sebastian Bach
• White Man Sleeps (1985) for string quartet by South African native Kevin Volans (b. 1949) draws on African traditions, and Songs of Sea and Sky (1987) for clarinet and piano by Australian composer Peter Sculthorpe (1929–2014) incorporates or imitates Aboriginal melodies
