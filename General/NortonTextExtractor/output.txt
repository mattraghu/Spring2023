• Hayden- he is best remembered for his symphonies and string quartets, which set standards of quality, style, content, form, and expressivity that other composers emulated.
• Mozart was profoundly affected by his experiences as a child prodigy. His early and thorough training gave him seemingly effortless command of the craft of composition, and his exposure at a young age to a wide range of music is reflected in his use of diverse styles to portray characters, convey moods, or heighten contrasts within a movement. 
• Mozart’s father, Leopold Mozart (1719–1787), was a violinist for the archbishop of Salzburg and became deputy Kapellmeister in 1763. He was a well-regarded composer
• serving the Esterházy family, the most powerful noble family in Hungary
• Prince Paul Anton Esterházy, a generous patron devoted to music, Haydn had to compose whatever music the prince commanded, conduct performances, train and supervise all the musical personnel, and keep the instruments in repair (see Source Reading). When Paul Anton died in 1762, his brother Nikolaus succeeded to the title; even more avid about music
• Die Entführung aus dem Serail, The Marriage of Figaro, Don Giovanni, Così fan tutte, The Magic Flute, 15 other operas and Singspiels, 17 masses, Requiem, 55 symphonies, 23 piano concertos, 15 other concertos, 26 string quartets, 19 piano sonatas, numerous songs, arias, serenades, divertimentos, dances; many other vocal and instrumental works (the traditional numbering of some Mozart works, such as symphonies 1–41 and piano concertos 1–27
• Through the early 1760s, Haydn composed mostly instrumental music for the prince—from orchestral works for concerts to baryton trios. After the move to Eszterháza, he also composed sacred vocal music and operas
• Wolfgang played prepared pieces, read concertos at sight, and improvised variations, fugues, fantasias, and arias. He was repeatedly tested by experts, who published reports on his performances and improvisations as if he were a wonder of nature
• Johann Christian Bach, whom Mozart met in London, had an important and lasting influence on the boy. Bach enriched his keyboard and symphonic works with features from Italian opera: songful themes, tasteful embellishments, appoggiaturas, and harmonic ambiguities. These traits, together with Bach’s consistent use of contrasting themes in concerto and sonata-form movements, appealed to Mozart
• Although he may have encountered Haydn’s quartets at this time, the six quartets he wrote in Vienna, K. 168–173, reflect local Viennese tastes more directly than they do Haydn’s influence. 
• At age sixteen, Mozart was appointed unpaid third concertmaster at Archbishop Colloredo’s court in Salzburg, where his duties included composing church music. Much more interested in opera and instrumental music, Mozart vainly sought a position elsewhere
• After spending eight years at the Salzburg court, Mozart received a welcome commission in 1780 to write an opera seria for Munich
• He sought broad and immediate appeal by devising themes that seemed familiar on first hearing and by following conventions for phrasing, form, and harmony
• Yet he made his music more interesting than most by introducing the unexpected, in numerous ways (see Source Reading). In a delightful alchemy, each aspect of his style reinforced the others: the familiar was enriched by contrasts, the reliance on conventions created listener expectations that made surprises possible, the diverse content clarified the form, and the intrinsic variety allowed him to evoke the sublime or create musical humor with equal skill.
• For the next ten years, Mozart earned his living as a freelance musician in Vienna
• The main source for Haydn’s idiom was the galant style, the predominant language of music by midcentury, marked by songful melody in short phrases, arranged in balanced periods, over light accompaniment
• From C. P. E. Bach, whose keyboard sonatas he studied diligently, Haydn adopted the heightened expressivity of the empfindsam style and an emphasis on making the most of each musical idea through variation and development
• the learned style of counterpoint, absorbed from church music,
• Mozart was appointed chamber music composer to Emperor Joseph
• String Quartet in E-flat Major, Op. 33, No. 2 (The Joke, 1781; NAWM 121d), shown in Example 23.1 (see p. 520). The tuneful theme—a small rounded binary form—seems simple on first hearing, but on closer examination, we find remarkable sophistication
• The theme derives entirely from a single idea presented in the first two measures
• The idea contains three motives distinguished by rhythm and articulation (marked a, b, and c), which recur in various permutations in what follows. Even when the rhythm repeats exactly (at measures 3, 9, and 11), Haydn gives it a new melodic contour, so that each phrase is both familiar and fresh
• Mozart’s music was enriched by new influences from three of the century’s greatest composers: Haydn, J. S. Bach, and Handel
• The opening idea does not close on the downbeat but spills over into the second half of the measure, lending it a playful, unfinished character
• Haydn creates a four-measure phrase to balance the two preceding two-measure units. Because the harmony avoids root-position cadences at measures 4 and 6, the listener does not sense a relaxation until the cadence in measure 8 closes the first period. Thus rhythm and harmony work together to sustain continuity throughout the entire period, despite its short, choppy melodic units. 
• After the first period repeats, the second section begins on the dominant with a complementary eight-measure period that continues to vary the opening idea. After this period cadences in measure 16, a simple reprise of the first period would bring the theme to a satisfactory conclusion. But before finally granting the reprise (at measure 29), Haydn delays its arrival by inserting a long elaboration on the dominant. Louder dynamic levels, diminished chords, diminuendos and crescendos, and a pedal point all create a sense of drama
• While Haydn built themes by varying small motives (see Example 23.1) or forming a series of contrasting gestures, Mozart’s themes tend to be songlike, reflecting Italian influence and his training in the galant style
• he humor is produced through incongruity of a sort that only experienced listeners and performers can notice
• composers of the time used contrast to delineate form, convey feelings, and provide variety. But Mozart’s skill in using diverse styles for these purposes was unparalleled. In Example 23.7, the following styles follow in quick succession
• This quartet earned the nickname The Joke because of this movement’s closing passage, shown in Example 23.2. Here Haydn inserts long rests between phrases of his theme. Through these surprising pauses, we are made aware of our expectations for how the music will continue. When measures 5–8 of the theme (see Example 23.1) are broken into two-measure phrases (measures 160–62 and 164–66), we suddenly realize that such two-measure units are what we expected at the beginning, and that Haydn’s original version was a witty variant. After the longest rest of all leads us to think that the piece is over, the opening figure returns once more
• The anomaly of Haydn’s converting an opening phrase into a final cadence points out a basic truth about the galant style: there is a strong differentiation of function between elements.
• Between 1782 and 1785, he wrote six quartets (K. 387, 421, 428, 458, 464, and 465), published in 1785 as his Op. 10. He dedicated them to Haydn
• Haydn has been called “the father of the symphony,” not because he invented the genre but because his symphonies set the pattern for later composers through their high quality, wide dissemination, and lasting appeal
• Opera was still the most prestigious musical genre, and Mozart eagerly sought opportunities to compose for the stage
• Haydn has been called “the father of the string quartet” with more justification than we have for the epithet “father of the symphony.”
• His encounters with and absorption of almost every current style enabled him to extend Haydn’s stylistic synthesis to an even wider range, making possible the masterful depiction of mood and character in his operas and the rich variety of his instrumental music. He equaled Haydn in balancing form and expression, and combining immediate with long-lasting appeal
